This is a guided project from scrimba.com. It is a single page static portfolio page with multiple nav items that anchor to different points in the page.

My learning objectives are to be able to

- structure a whole page
- name properly
- translate a design spec into css
- write better flexbox/grid code
- use pseudo-classes/elements in my own projects
- ++

++ This project on itself does not dive deep into these topics. But my intention is to take multiple dabbling detours as I go through this project, with this project being the central theme, a guideline that keeps me moving forward.
