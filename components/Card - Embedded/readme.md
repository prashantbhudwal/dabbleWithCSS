# Embedded Card Component

# Intentions

This card component is intended to mimic the following scenario

- the light source is overhead
- the observer is looking at the component at a slightly downward angle
- the component is embedded in the surface
  - The inner elements of the component
  - are either slightly raised
    - image plate
    - button plates
  - or flush on it
    - typography

# Assumptions

The assumptions are as follows

- when the light hits the surface, the observer sees
- the embedded component brighter than the surface.
- the whole component with
  - slight shadow under the top edge
  - light reflect of the inside of the bottom edge
- the plates with
  - reflections at the top of the plate
  - drop shadow under the plate
- all the elements wit
